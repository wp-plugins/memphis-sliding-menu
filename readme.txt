== Description ==

A sliding menu for WordPress

== Installation ==

From the WordPress plugin menu click on Add New and search for Memphis Documents Library

Instead of searching for a plugin you can directly upload the plugin zip file by clicking on Upload:

Use the browse button to select the plugin zip file that was downloaded, then click on Install Now. The plugin will be uploaded to your blog and installed. It can then be activated.

Once uploaded the configuration menu is located in either the "Memphis" menu with the heading of "Documents" in the Dashboard or in the "Memphis Docs" menu.
